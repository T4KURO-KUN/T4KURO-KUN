T4K ðŸŒŒ ~ whoami

"I speak English and French and have a few passions. In Tech, I enjoy writing code to create apps and websites, making ideas into real tools. Cybersecurity is fascinating because I want to learn to protect computers and keep data safe. Anime or Manga is more than entertainment; it helps me improve my English, even more than games. Gaming is my escape from everyday problems and reality, where I can immerse myself in exciting worlds and challenges."

I exclusively use Arch Linux now, having switched from Windows. I'm familiar with Arch Linux basics, which is a lightweight and minimal version of Linux.
